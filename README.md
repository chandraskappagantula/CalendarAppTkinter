# CalendarAppTkinter
A personal calendar app made with the `Tkinter`, `datetime`, and `calendar` modules in Python. Includes a productivity manager, and links to Spotify for music management. 

> **Installation**

Ensure that all assets and main `.py` file are placed in the same directory. You need to have the `PIL` library installed with the following: `pip install pillow`. You may want to check which modules are already installed with `python -m pip list`. (`.exe` file coming soon)

> **Purpose**

This is a personal calendar app that I programmed for my own use. 

> **Roadmap**

 - Finish the strikethrough system for events so that it works correctly. (It has a lot of bugs as of right now) (Skipping this so I can add other features - all other event features work properly besides the strikethrough feature - can't figure out why and it's infuriating)
 - Add a visual list for each date on the calendar.
 - ~~Create a "focus timer" system which starts a timer (similar to the Microsoft Clock app's focus system on Windows 11)~~
 - ~~Graph the user's productivity over a certain month based on how many hours they focus each day.~~
 - Connect to spotify for music during focus sessions using Spotify API.
 - Store the internal data in lists within text files in the same directory (this way the data is saved even after closing the GUI).
 - Clear old data stored in the text files to speed up the program.
 - ~~Convert this program to an `.exe` file for personal use, using pyexe module from PIP.~~ (instructions coming soon on how to do it)
